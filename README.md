[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tableau/webdataconnector/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://coveralls.io/github/tableau/webdataconnector?branch=dev) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tableau/webdataconnector.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/tableau/webdataconnector)

This is the development branch of the web data connector platform. For information about the current version, see the
[documentation](http://tableau.github.io/webdataconnector/).

Since we just released version 2.1 of the web data connector, there are no features in development currently in the simulator.  This will be updated soon.
